It propelled me to great feats, many of which I enjoyed, others made life difficult.\n\n## College\n\nI became a **Division 1** college athlete. Working out and exercise has helped me develop into a strong and confident person. I want to help others achieve the same level of self confidence and reach the same goals.",
